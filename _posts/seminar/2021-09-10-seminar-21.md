## Introduction
+ Concept:Control-Flow Integrity (CFI) is an effective approach to mitigating control-flow hijacking attacks.
+ Goal:The goal of CFI is to restrict the set of possible control-flow transfers to those that are strictly required for correct program execution.
+ Function:Prevent control-flow hijacking attacks such as Return-Oriented Programming (ROP)  from working because they would cause the program to execute control-flow transfers,which are illegal under CFI.
+ Control-Flow Hijacking
+ Code-Injection Attack
+ Code-Reuse Attack
+ Mainstream Solution
+ Challenge
+ Causes
